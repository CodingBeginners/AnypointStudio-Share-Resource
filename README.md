# AnypointStudio-Share-Resource
 Domain projects in mule are a way to share resources among multiple mule applications. Think of it just like declaring global connector configurations but instead of sharing the configurations within multiple flows in a single application, it is now shared across multiple flows and multiple applications. Every mule project is associated to a domain. If you observed the mule-deploy Properties, by default the domain value is set as “default”. This means every project has its own independent domain and no application is sharing any resources outside its boundary.
